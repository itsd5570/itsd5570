#### 1. **Daily Logins and Rewards**

One of the easiest and most straightforward ways to get more dice in Monopoly Go is by logging in daily. The game typically offers daily rewards, and you might get a free dice or dice-related bonus for consecutive logins.

##### Why It Works:
- **Targeted rewards**: You know exactly what to aim for.
- **Leveling up**: Many achievements are tied to leveling up, and dice often come as rewards for higher levels.

#### 3. **Participating in Events**

Monopoly Go frequently hosts special in-game events. These events can give you the opportunity to earn dice as rewards for completing event-specific tasks. For example, events may offer a limited-time bonus for collecting specific items or completing certain objectives.

- **No cost involved**: You simply watch an ad and get rewarded with dice.

#### 5. **Connecting to Social Media or Friends**

Monopoly Go sometimes offers free dice as a reward for connecting your account to social media platforms or for linking your account to a friend. Some games offer bonus dice for referring friends to join or completing certain social media-based tasks.

##### Why It Works:
- **Social incentives**: This encourages you to share the game with others, and you both benefit from the dice bonuses.
- **One-time rewards**: Some rewards come with bonuses for doing these tasks once.

#### 6. **Using Free Dice from Special Offers and Promotions**

Monopoly Go may occasionally have promotions or special offers that include free dice. These promotions often show up during holidays or other special events and may be time-limited. Keep an eye on the game for pop-up promotions offering dice.

##### Why It Works:
- **Free bonuses**: Promotions usually offer free items, including dice, without any effort.
- **Limited-time offers**: These can sometimes provide large amounts of dice.

#### 7. **Purchasing Dice with In-game Currency (No Real Money)**

While not truly free, you can acquire more dice using in-game currency, which you can earn through gameplay. By focusing on collecting this currency, you can exchange it for dice without spending real money.

##### Why It Works:

- **Progression-based**: Using in-game currency often ties your rewards to your overall progression in the game.
