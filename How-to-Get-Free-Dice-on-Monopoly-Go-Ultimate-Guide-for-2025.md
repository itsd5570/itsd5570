## What is Monopoly Go?

Monopoly Go is the digital adaptation of the traditional board game "Monopoly." In this mobile version, players compete against each other to collect properties, build houses and hotels, and dominate the game board. One of the most exciting aspects of Monopoly Go is the use of dice to move around the board. Each roll of the dice determines how far a player will travel and what properties they can buy. The game has captured millions of players worldwide, offering both nostalgia and a fresh gaming experience.

## Why Do You Need Dice in Monopoly Go?

Dice are essential for progressing in Monopoly Go. Each roll determines your move, which in turn dictates which property you land on. Without enough dice, your progress is slowed down significantly, which can make the game less enjoyable and hinder your ability to advance. 

Having a constant supply of dice ensures that you can keep making moves and gaining rewards. If you run out of dice, you may need to wait or spend real money to continue playing, which can be frustrating for players who prefer to avoid in-app purchases.
